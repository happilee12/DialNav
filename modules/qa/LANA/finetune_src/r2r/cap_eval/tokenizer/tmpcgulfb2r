Hi I found you. Please get out of the bathroom to the bedroom. Next, exit the bedroom as well and you will find a hallway. Move to the door on you right and you will see a living room with a staircase on your left. Climb up the stairs
great, now I want you to face the outdoors, and head to the hallway on your right. take 2-3 steps to your right, and you will enter a room with a white AK-47 on a black background on the wall. that is your target room. when you look around, you will find a poster for the movie 'godfather'
Just to make sure we're on the same page, is the stair covered with grey-ish carpet? Because If it's made of tile(like bathroom tiles) and not carpet, I'll have to change my instructions.
This is a bit tricky... Placing the stairs right behind you on the south direction, There will be two doors in front of you. Go to the second door, and you'll see the hallway to bathroom and a bedroom with stripe-patterned blankets. Go all the way through the hallway to bathroom. That is the goal room. Good job.
Are you in the room with basketball?
Ok walk down the hallway and then take a left turn when you see the banister. Then, at the end of that hallway there should be a bedroom and that's our target
My pleasure. Now you can press the button!
yes that is correct. Good work!
I think so. The phone is on the left and a white long flower is on the right side of the table. The table is glass with metal frames.
Okay, you must turn left, and take the spiral stairway to go up to the third floor. Once you got up, walk pass the hallway, and go into the left room. There is a purple flower in front of your goal bedroom.
Great! come into the bedroom, and go straight all the way until you reach a dining room with a glass table and white chairs. Then you'll see a living room with a tv. Facing the tv, go into the hallway on the left. The room on your right is our goal room.
ok, I think I can tell where you are. the target room is the kitchen of the house, and it is one the 1st floor. the kitchen is right adjacent to the stairway on the 1st floor. so naturall, our goal should be to find the staircase. You are currently on the balcony on the 2nd floor. let's focus on finding the staircase first. I want you to turn towards the house and walk straight forwards. you will find a bedroom. go past the bedroom, and you will pass by a room of some sorts. and you will fine the staircase. remember, you are on the 2nd floor. once you get to the staircase, go down 1 floor. let's talk after you reach the 1st floor.
Yes, so you just go upstairs and then turn left where you see a closed white door. Passing this door, you will face the bathroom but don't go there, turn left and enter the bedroom with blue wall and light blanket. This is our destination
Do the stairs turn right in front of a large, four sectioned white window? If so, you're on the third floor, so go down the stairs to the second floor. Walk straight until you're in the further half of the room. That's the target room.
get out of the room and you'll see stairs downward; take stairs down until you see a bedroom right in front of you. get into that bedroom, look at your left, and there must be a small bathroom connected to the bedroom. that bathroom is the goal space
Okay. Behind the kitchen there should be a staircase that you can take to go downstairs. Once you are down make a U-turn and go down another staircase right below the first stair you took. Once you are down again keep going straight until you see a room with a white AK-47 framed on the wall. That is the goal room

I think I found you. there is a picture of the last supper on the wall right? this is not the target room. you are on the 3rd floor, and the target room is on the 1st floor. so first, let's focus on finding the staircase. I want you to face the wall with the picture of the 'the last supper', turn right, and head straight for 4-5 steps. You will find the staircase. it has a picture of a blue skinned person. let's first head to the staircase first

Alright! I can see where you are. Facing the projector screen, take the right door. You will see an exit to your left right before the staircase. Take this exit to go to the garage. Once inside, you will see a small staircase that leads you further down to a room with lots of construction materials. You will see a brown open door in front that leads to the porch.

Great work!
Ok I think I know where you are. this house has 3 floors, and the target room is on the 2nd floor (the same floor we are on). therefore we will not be going up or down any staircases. However, the staircases will be very useful benchmarks for where we are going. I want you to face the 'IMPACT HUB' lettering. Now turn left, and head 7 steps straight until you reach the black staircase (it's a very small staircase). once you get there, you will see a vertical crimson/white placard that has the letters 'IMPACT HUB Triest'. you will also see a small vertical mirror on your 11 0'clock side. let's get here first.
